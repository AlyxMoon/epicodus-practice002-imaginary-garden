### stuff to do
- convert data from the geolocation to pass to the next API
- convert results from dayCycle into local time zone

### General concept:

- get sunrise and sunset data via API
  - need to get location of user first
- represent in some fashion how the sun will rise and set
- add ability to put in some plants and show how much sun they are getting

- add seasons

- ability to water crops
- ability to add crops into greenhouse
- ability to set the kelvin color temperature in the greenhouse

we could use the data to find optimal times to pull tarp if a farmer wanted to maximize.
